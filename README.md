#Project-Heights

Welcome to the Project Heights beta stage.

To begin working on your own project, download or clone the repo and get at it!

An example has been included to show you how to use the engine. Depending on
your browser, you may need to upload the example to try it if it does not work
locally.

You can find the documentaion website [right here](http://docs.heightsjs.com).

##What do you mean by "beta"?
As a beta tester/developer, it is up to you to help get Project Heights to its
full potential. What that really means is up to you. If you are more interested
in the engine side of things, you can help develop the engine and fix bugs or
add useful functionality. If you are more into developing a game of your own,
use the engine to do so and report on what you would like to see so we can get
it implemented asap! You can also report bugs via GitHub, and please do!!

If you have any questions at all, you can email me at twisterghost@gmail.com
and I will be happy to answer or even help you make your game.

You can also email the Project Heights beta members by sending an email to
projectheights@googlegroups.com.

Enjoy, and thank you for your participation!
